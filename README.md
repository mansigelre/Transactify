# 💳 Transactify – ATM Simulation System

**Transactify** is a **Java-based ATM simulation project** that mimics the essential operations of a real Automated Teller Machine (ATM).  
It allows users to securely log in, check balances, deposit money, withdraw cash, and transfer funds — all within a console-based environment.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User starts the program.  
2. Logs in using an **account number** and **PIN**.  
3. The system validates credentials and displays an operations menu:
   - Withdraw Cash  
   - Deposit Money  
   - Check Balance  
   - Transfer Funds  
   - Mini Statement  
   - Exit  

4. Each operation updates the user’s data and shows the updated balance.  
5. All interactions happen through the console for a realistic ATM-like flow.
